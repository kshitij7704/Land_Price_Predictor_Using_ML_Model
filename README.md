# Land_Price_Predictor_Using_ML_Model
The project will be taking into account various factors that will affect the prices of the land, and after considering them will predict the price for that land.
To make this project, first I have generated some fictional data due to the unavaliabilty of actual dataset, I have used numpy library to genrated some fictional dataset. Then to just demostrate that this model is capable of extracting data from a web page also by using webscrapping techniques, a fictional webpage is also created. I have also performed EDA on the dataset using pandas library. Further used matplotlib and seaborn to visualise the dataset. Finally for model creation and training sklearn library is used.
